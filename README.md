# renovate-config
A [shareable config](https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-presets/) for [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/).

## About
A shereable Renovate config with some simple grouping by package managers and update types to keep pull request counts down. It also applies some helpful labels depending on the updates being performed. This preset configures Renovate to run just before the weekend. 

See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more information and updates.
